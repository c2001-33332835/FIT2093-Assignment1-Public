### How to use

Install `matplotlib` library and run `analysis.py`. This should generate all the graph as png files in your directory.

### Academic Integrity Notice

`encryption.py` includes the encrypt and decrypt function for Canary cipher, however its been obfuscated as it contains solutions for A1.

Publicly revealing the assignment solution could be a breach of Academic Integrity, but since I doubt anyone will spend effort to try to reverse engineer it, I think `encryption.py` in its current state does not consider to be breaking the rules.
